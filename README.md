SpringArtwork-Public
=================
## This repo
This repo serves as the place to report bugs found within SpringArtwork. Having them all at one place, it's easier for everyone else to see progress about an issue. It's also easier for me instead of having everything spread out across Reddit, Twitter and emails.

If you're experiencing a bug, please open an issue and I'll look at it as soon as I can. Please include iOS version, device model and any other usable information needed to reproduce the problem.

## Short description
*Compatible with iOS 11 to 13*
